how to use Tachyons
- install tachyons in project root
- import 'tackyons' in component that you want to use classes
- search and add class names

You can export a const from a file just like a funtion
- look at how we used robot.js 

Note: on imports that arent default you have to destructure

Rendering a list
- if you give react a list of components
- it is smart enough to know how to deal with it
