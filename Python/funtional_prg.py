# Funtional programming is all bout separation of concerns
# that means each part conserns itself about one that its good at
# separate data and funtions

# Pure funtions
    # same input same output
    # should not have side effects 
        # - changes nothing but input
        # doenst care about the outside world
        # different parts of the program doesnt touch each other
